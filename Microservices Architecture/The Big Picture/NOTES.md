# Microservices: The Big Picture

*From the Pluralsight course: https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/microservices-big-picture/table-of-contents*

## Software Development Lifecycle

### Software Development Stages

1. Requirements gathering
2. Plan & Design
3. Development
4. Testing
5. Release
6. Monitoring
7. Maintenance

### Parties

- Users and business analysts - gather requirements, write down user stores and plan the execution
- Developers, web designers and architects design and develop the software
- Project managers coordinate the product and synchronize everyone
- The operational team is responsible for monitoring, dealing with security and making sure the software is up and running

## What are Microservices?

A set of practices aimed to increase the speed and efficiency of development ond management of software solutions that scale. It is technology-agnostic. It is the principles and architectural patterns that will create a microservice architecture.

A microservice is build around a business capability and can be independently deployed.

### Micro...

**Bounded context:** It must do one thing and do it well. So, Micro refers to the scope of functionality. In order to do this sub-domains have to be identified  and a microservice to be built for each.

### ...Service

A service is an independently deployable component that supports interoperability through message based communication.

With microservices, the Software Development Stages iterate on smaller periods and the parties (teams) are also smaller. Having many services means more teams, that must communicate with each other.
