# C# Fundamentals

## Overview

C# is part of .NET.

.NET Ecosystem - Developer Platform from Microsoft which allows us to build applications. It includes different languages, libraries and tools. .NET 6 is cross-platform.

Types of applications:

- Console apps
- Desktop apps
- Web apps

## Setting-Up the Work Environment

Projects are containers for code files. Once we are done with editing, projects are compiled by the compiler into executable files (assembly).
